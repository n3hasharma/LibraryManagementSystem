# LibraryManagementSystem
This project is a Library Management System developed in Java using Swing (JFrame) for the graphical user interface and JDBC for database connectivity with MySQL. It allows the admin to add, update, and manage books efficiently while tracking issued books and calculating fines automatically (₹10 per day after 10 days). The system includes login functionality for both admin and users, ensuring secure access. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface for managing library records, viewing book availability, and maintaining student issue logs. The project connects to a MySQL database named techhh through JDBC (com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver), storing details such as book ID, title, author, publisher, quantity, student name, and issue date.
